    <h2>The best way to take reliable random decisions</h2>
    <h3>Concept:</h3>
    <p>
        There are many tools to choose an option at random for you.
        However, these choices are not reliable.
        That is, if you ask an other time to choose between the same set of options, you will get a different answer.
        This may be suitable to decide what to cook, however, it isn't to make life decision (such as choosing
        university).
    </p>
    <p>
        Choice Maker is a solution to have a persistent random choice:
        It choose randomly from your set of options, and this decision will remain in time, no matter how many times the
        user reset the choice.
