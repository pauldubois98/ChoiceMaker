        <h4>Concept:</h4>
        <p>
            There are many tools to choose an option at random for you. However, these choices are not reliable. That
            is, if you ask an other time to choose between the same set of options, you will get a different answer.
            This may be suitable to decide what to cook, however, it isn't to make life decision (such as choosing
            university).
        </p>
        <p>
            Choice Maker is a solution to have a persistent random choice:
            It chooses randomly from a set of options, but this random choice will be always the same no matter how many
            times the user reset the choice and whoever asks the random choice among the same set of alternatives. But
            the choice is really random and uniform across alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, the random choice satisfies transitivity meaning that dominated alternative in a choice set will
            always be in any other choice set that includes this dominated alternative and the randomly chosen one (for
            example if the random choice among A B C is A, then B or C cannot be chosen randomly among A B C D).

            <em>Note that it isn't advise to use this tool for decisions as important as your future university.</em>
